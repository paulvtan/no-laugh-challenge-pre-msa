# A Simple Real-time Emotion Analyzer.

## Introduction

Welcome back to part 2 of **Cognitive Services** module. I hope you are learning lots and enjoying it so far! ðŸ“š

In this module we will be building an emotion analyzer component that detects and responses as player's emotion changes (aka. smiling) as they watch a montage of cat videos or you know, funny stuffs. ðŸ˜¹

Utilizing your webcam and cognitive services, we will build a movable camera preview components with a dynamic 'hapiness' meter. As you may have guessed, if the meter filled up to 100% then the player will be prompted a **'GAME OVER'** banner. 

So you better keep a straight face!

 ## 1. Building a webcam component.
 
 In this section, we will first build our **MyWebcam** component to display the video feed on the screen as well as taking care of sending/retreiving API data.
 
We will use **_react-webcam_** package from **npm** to help us implement the webcam component. 

### 1.1 Install **react-webcam** package using npm 

Open powershell in the project directory and type `npm i react-webcam` to install **react-webcam** package from node.js package manager npm.

ðŸ’¡ **Tips:** Shift right click -> Open PowerShell window here

### 1.2 Create a webcam component

Create a new JavaScript file under the **components** folder called **MyWebcam.js**.

Use `import Webcam from "react-webcam";`, and Create a class **MyWebcam.js**, which returns `<Webcam />` component. 

At the bottom don't forget to `export default MyWebcam` class component so that it is made available to use by other components.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import Webcam from "react-webcam";
 
class MyWebcam extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Webcam />;
  }
}

export default MyWebcam
```
