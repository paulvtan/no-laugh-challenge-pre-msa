Introduction
============

<b>Welcome all!!</b> Whether you are new to programming or a returning veteren, I hope you are exited to learn how you can utilize the power of <b>Microsoft Cognitive services</b> to enhance your web application!

#### *Cognitive Services, what's that?* 

Microsoft cognitive services APIs help empower your apps and websites in many ways. These APIs allows us to easily integrate the power of <b>Machine Learning</b> into your applications using the REST API allowing them to intelligently interact with user in ways we never imagined!

Some of the capabilities cognitive services provide.

## So what am I getting out of this guide?

If you have read 'til this point I'm glad you are interested! In this module of **MSA 2019**, we will be making a simple React JS web application in form of **'Try not to laugh challenge the game'** *(if you have not heard of this challenge just google it üòõ)*. 

Your app will utilize the power of **Vision API** *(Face)* in order to detect and response to player's emotion in **real time!!**

So, basically not only you will learn about building a basic web application in **React JS** *(Which is really popular right now)* and implementing AI capabilities into your web app, you will finish this module with a fully functional web application you can show off to your mates or employers. üëç

## Knowledge Requirements

Don't be intimidated, this guide aims to be easy enough for anyone with little to no prior programming experience to follow.

**(However, *passion* is required!).**

Keep in mind that for the purpose of keeping this guide simple and straight forward as a practical example for demonstrating cognitive services in action, it is required that you further study the area where you find yourself lack understanding. As per usual, use [MSA Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/msaccelerator/) to ask questions, reach out to MSPs, friends but remember to Google for answers first. üòä 

**However skills in following domain will helps**

**1. Basic programming (JavaScript).**
