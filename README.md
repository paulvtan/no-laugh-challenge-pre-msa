Introduction
============

<b>Welcome all!!</b> Whether you are new to programming or a returning veteren, I hope you are exited to learn how you can utilize the power of <b>Microsoft Cognitive services</b> to enhance your web application!

#### *Cognitive Services, what's that?* 

Microsoft cognitive services APIs help empower your apps and websites in many ways. These APIs allows us to easily integrate the power of <b>Machine Learning</b> into your applications using the REST API allowing them to intelligently interact with user in ways we never imagined!

Some of the capabilities cognitive services provide.

## So what am I getting out of this guide?

If you have read 'til this point I'm glad you are interested! In this module of **MSA 2019**, we will be making a simple React JS web application in form of **'Try not to laugh challenge the game'** *(if you have not heard of this challenge just google it üòõ)*. 

Your app will utilize the power of **Vision API** *(Face)* in order to detect and response to player's emotion in **real time!!**

So, basically not only you will learn about building a basic web application in **React JS** *(Which is really popular right now)* and implementing AI capabilities into your web app, you will finish this module with a fully functional web application you can show off to your mates or employers. üëç

## Knowledge Requirements

Don't be intimidated, this guide aims to be easy enough for anyone with little to no prior programming experience to follow.

**(However, *passion* is required!).**

Keep in mind that for the purpose of keeping this guide simple and straight forward as a practical example for demonstrating cognitive services in action, we will not be going into much details around programming. 

It is required that you further study the area where you find yourself lack understanding. As per usual, use [MSA Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/msaccelerator/) to ask questions, reach out to MSPs, friends but remember to Google for answers first. üòä 

**However skills in following domain will helps**

**1. Basic programming (JavaScript).**

## Getting Started

Before we get started you will need to equip yourself with the right tools, follow the remaining instruction below to setup your developmnet environment. 

#### *Setting up your development environment*

1. **Visual Studio Code**&nbsp;<img src="images/visualstudiocode.png"  width="16" alt="VS Code Logo"/>

      - Visual Studio is a perfect code editor for the job as it's easy to setup and provides great supports for web development.               [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. **GitHub + Git & GitHub Desktop** <img src="images/GitHubLogo.svg"  width="24" alt="GitHub Logo"/> + <img src="images/GitHubDesktopLogo.png"  width="27" alt="GitHub Desktop Logo"/> 

      - We will be using **GitHub**, which utilizes Git for our version control. [Get Started with GitHub & Git here](https://github.com/NZMSA/2017-Phase-1-Module-2/tree/master/2.%20Introduction%20to%20Git)
      
      - **GitHub Desktop** is a handy GUI desktop application, which helps you easily work with your GitHub's repo instead of through Git command line. [Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
      
3. **Node.js** <img src="images/nodejslogo.png"  width="40" alt="Node.js Logo"/>
     
     - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
     
4. **NPM** <img src="images/npmlogo.png"  width="40" alt="npm Logo"/>

     - npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. Npm comes with Node.js installation, and it allows us to easily create react application from boilerplate code or install other required libraries later on. *(Comes with Node.js)*
